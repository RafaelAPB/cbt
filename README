--- The following comments are from Lesi Wang

The project has been converted to a Maven project so compilation can be done via command line. The existing compilation and execution methods are not affected.
The newly added pom.xml has the definition of maven, it declares dependencies and "manifest
mainClass" which is the start point when executing a jar. Maven also has IDE plugins for Eclipse and IntelliJ if the UI tool is preferred.
To compile, run mvn clean install (or mvn install) at the project level, Maven and Java are needed to compile. Maven 3.6.1 and Java 1.8 have been tested working on macOS 10.14.6 
After successful compilation, one can execute by  java -jar target/CrossChain-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar {parameters}, i.e java -jar target/CrossChain-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar Node.A true
The jar file is portable and it can be deployed to other hosts and executed.
